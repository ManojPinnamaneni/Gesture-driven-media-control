# Gesture-driven-media-control

This project includes control of media with the gestures made. 
For this project, i have used basics of deep learning for hand movements and gestures recognition. 
I have developed a media player which supports multiple formats of media such as mp3, mp4, mkv. 
This media player is developed using tkinter which is a python framework, using these elements, we can control and operate media the media player by assigning different controls to different gestures suck as play, pause, volume increase and decrease, seeking the video forward and backward. 
I have used libraries such as mediapipe, opencv, pyautogui for gesture recognition and control.
